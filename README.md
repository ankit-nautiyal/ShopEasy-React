# ShopEasy - Shopping Website

ShopEasy is a responsive e-commerce website built as a front-end internship assignment. It uses React with the Fake Store API to provide a seamless shopping experience, including user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and a checkout process. The application features a clean UI, mobile-first design, and global state management for the cart.

## Features

- **Login Page**:
  - Authenticate users via Fake Store API's `/auth/login` endpoint.
  - Store JWT token in `localStorage`.
  - Redirect to the home page on successful login.
- **Product Listing (Home)**:
  - Fetch and display products in a responsive grid.
  - Filter products by category using `/products/category/:category`.
  - Search bar to filter products by title.
- **Product Detail Page**:
  - Display detailed product info (image, title, description, price).
  - "Add to Cart" functionality.
- **Cart Page**:
  - View cart items with quantity controls and removal options.
  - Calculate total price dynamically.
  - Checkout clears the cart and shows a confirmation popup (auto-closes after 4 seconds).
- **Header**:
  - Navigation links to Home, Cart, and Logout.
  - Displays real-time cart item count.
  - Logout clears JWT and redirects to Login.
- **Footer**:
  - Includes brand info, contact details, and social media links.
  - Responsive design with a dynamic copyright year.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Mobile-first approach using plain CSS.
  - Adapts seamlessly to desktop and mobile devices.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** (v8 or higher)
- A modern web browser

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shopping-website.git
   cd shopping-website
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser (port may vary).

4. **Build for Production** (Optional):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The production-ready files will be in the `dist/` folder.

## Usage

1. **Login**:
   - Use Fake Store API credentials (e.g., `username: "mor_2314"`, `password: "83r5^_"`).
   - On success, you’ll be redirected to the home page.
2. **Browse Products**:
   - Filter by category or search by product name.
   - Click a product to view details.
3. **Manage Cart**:
   - Add products to the cart from the product detail page.
   - Update quantities or remove items in the cart.
   - Click "Checkout" to place an order (cart clears, popup appears).
4. **Logout**:
   - Click "Logout" in the header to clear the JWT and return to the login page.

## Testing

- **API Testing**:
  - Ensure the Fake Store API (`https://fakestoreapi.com`) is accessible.
  - Test login with provided credentials.
- **UI Testing**:
  - Verify responsiveness on mobile (<600px) and desktop.
  - Check navigation, cart updates, and popup behavior.
- **Functionality**:
  - Confirm cart state persists across pages.
  - Test checkout clears the cart and shows the confirmation.

## Future Improvements

- **Protected Routes**: Redirect to login if no JWT is found.
- **Error Handling**: Display user-friendly messages for API failures.
- **Styling**: Add animations or use a CSS framework like Tailwind.
- **Social Icons**: Integrate real social media links with icons (e.g., `react-icons`).
- **Local Storage for Cart**: Persist cart state across sessions.
